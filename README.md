# The Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains

This repository contains the Jekyll source for the website of [The Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains](https://stpeterspeterborough.ca/), an historic church located in Peterborough, Ontario. This document outlines some of the technical details behind the website and is intended as a primer of sorts on the chosen technology stack. Its intended audience is primarily office or clerical staff interested in making content changes to the site, but also anyone curious as to some of the design and implementation details.

There are many advantages to static sites, but the various technical prerequisites for operating a static site, though straightforward for those with technical skills, have proven to be barriers to non-technical staff needing to update content. With no desire on my part to adopt a server-based CMS, I saw the need to engineer a workaround to offer some level of interactivity for staff. To that end, I recently implemented a 'solution' which employs Twitter as a user interface and backing store, and a Google Cloud Function which scans some Twitter collections we created for tweets containing content to be committed as source changes to the site repository.

It's all kind of kludgy, by no means a 'perfect' solution, but it fills the usability gap, and the church gets to retain free web hosting so graciously provided by GitHub Pages.

For the cloud function, see https://github.com/stpeterinchains/refresh.

**TL;DR** — Scroll down to [Reference](#reference) for info on the YAML document structures expected in the four Twitter collections.


## General Architecture

The Cathedral website is known, technically, as a *static site*. It's built using the **Jekyll** static site generator and hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**.

The term *static site* does not mean that pages are static—as in unchanging. It means there is no logic—specialized programming—executed by the host web server for each page view, in contrast to **WordPress**-based sites, for example. Instead, the pages of a static site are pre-generated, typically served from fast CDNs (content delivery networks), and transferred verbatim to visitors' web browsers. This makes static sites fast and cheap to host.

The *source files* for The Cathedral website live in a **git** *repository* on **GitHub**. Git is a popular *version control system* used by software developers, and GitHub is a popular social media website based on Git dedicated to software development. GitHub Pages is a web hosting service dedicated to static sites operated by GitHub. A repository is a place where files and directories belonging to a project are stored. Version control is a system that manages changes to a project over time. In the case of The Cathedral website, when changes to any of its source files are committed to the repository on GitHub, GitHub Pages automatically re-generates the files that comprise what's presented to visitors.

Among other reason, this technology stack was chosen for its advantages in hosting costs and versatility. However, the principal trade-off is the technical prerequisites needed to manage and make changes to the site. To bridge this gap, we use **Twitter** along with a periodic background *cloud function* running on **Google Cloud Platform**.


## Twitter and Google Cloud Platform

A Twitter *timeline* is a *chronology*. Each new tweet represents the timeline owner's most recent *status*, forming a sort of ongoing record of activity in the life of that person or organization. Newer tweets have greater relevance, while older ones are gradually pushed downward, into the past. In addition to its chronological nature, a Twitter timeline is also a *data store*. Regardless of where (or when?) a tweet exists in its chronology, it is stored forever (unless explicitly deleted) and can be accessed when needed.

In addition to timelines, Twitter also supports a structure called a *collection*. You work with collections using **Tweetdeck**, Twitter's alternative web user interface which exposes advanced functionality. Tweets from any timeline can be placed in a collection and *arranged in any order*. Adding a tweet to a collection does not make a copy of the tweet. It still exists in one place—its own timeline. Instead, a *reference* to the tweet is placed in the collection. Removing a tweet from a collection deletes only the reference, not the actual tweet.

The Cathedral website employs Twitter to support an interactive method for updating content. Specially written tweets contain content intended for the website. Alongside other tweets, these tweets are stored in the timeline in chronological order, but the collections let us organize the tweets in the order we need. Used this way, Twitter becomes a kind of database backing the website.

Along with [@cathedralstpet](https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet), The Cathedral's Twitter timeline, we define four purpose-specific collections:

Title          | Collection
:----          | :---------
Announcements  | https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1270455700167307267
Bulletins      | https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1253031034083520512
Regular Events | https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1253030938398859265
Special Events | https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1253030671557308420

These collections correspond to sections on the [home page](https://stpeterspeterborough.ca). By writing tweets in a specific way (covered below) and adding those tweets to the appropriate collection, we can update content in those sections without touching the website's source code.

Writing tweets does not, by itself, change the website. The other moving part is a cloud function running on Google Cloud Platform that periodically checks the collections for changes. The function, each time it wakes, fetches the tweets and computes a hash in each collection. When changes are detected, the function commits the data to the repository in order to trigger the site re-generation process.


## Structured text: YAML and Markdown

Ordinary tweets on **@cathedralstpet** are written as usual—in free-form, natural-language English. However, tweets intended to represent content for the website are written as *structured text*. Structured text is text that adheres to a particular syntax designed to allow regularly occurring *elements* to be easily identifiable by an automated process (the above cloud function). The elements are *data fields* that appear within the document corresponding to such things as titles, dates, and other items that describe, say, an announcement or a scheduled event to be displayed on the website. Each of the above collections expects YAML documents to have a particular set of data fields (covered below) specific to its purpose.

**YAML** is a syntax for structured text. The tweets we write to make changes to the website are written as small *YAML documents*. YAML was chosen from among several other formats for its readability by both humans and machines. Human-readability is an important consideration since these special tweets will be visible in the timeline mixed in with ordinary tweets, They should be at least somewhat meaningful when encountered by a human.

All tweets, as well as all YAML documents (regardless of where they are used), are written as *plaintext*. Plaintext is text devoid of visual formatting. This is in contrast to other contexts, such as word processing, where formatting attributes are intrinsic properties of the text itself. While tweets and YAML documents are plaintext, we need descriptive text intended for the website to allow for some visual embellishment. In most of our YAML documents, descriptive text supports a syntax called **Markdown**. Markdown is used in plaintext environments to embellish ordinary text with indicators that represent visual formatting or the insertion of special objects. For example, in Markdown we write **\*\*bold\*\*** text enclosed in double-asterisks and *\*italic\** text enclosed in single-asterisks. To represent a hyperlink, we write \[hyperlinks\]\(https://example.com/\) using this bracket-and-parentheses syntax, where the display text appears between the brackets and the URL between the parentheses.

Though Markdown is written as plaintext, it is ultimately rendered with the various indicators transformed into the intended visual formatting or special objects. Markdown syntax supports a wide range of indicators, for document structure and text styling, and for embeddable objects such as hyperlinks, images, and tables. This document is written in Markdown and makes use of many of its features (e.g., styling, headings, code blocks, hyperlinks, tables). However, note that only a small subset of these features are usable in descriptive text within our YAML documents.

For more information on YAML, see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) or [this short video](https://youtu.be/cdLNKUoMc6c) on YouTube. When working with YAML, a *validator* can be a useful tool. A YAML validator allows you to write (or paste) YAML to be parsed against the rules of the syntax. This is recommended prior to posting a tweet containing a YAML document. There are many available online; try [this validator](https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator). Paste YAML in the left-side pane, then click **Validate YAML** to see a report in the right-side pane. Only valid YAML should be entered as a tweet to be added to one of the above collections.

For information on Markdown, please see this [introductory article by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) or [this short video](https://youtu.be/2JE66WFpaII). Note that only the *Styling text* and *Links* sections in the GitHub article are a prerequisites. In the same way a validator is useful for working with YAML, a *preview tool* is useful for viewing raw Markdown text alongside how it will eventually be rendered. Try [this preview tool](https://stackedit.io/app). Markdown written in the left-side pane is rendered in the right-side pane.


## An example YAML document

The anatomy of the YAML documents we place in our collections follows a basic pattern. The following is an example YAML document that defines an announcement:

```
# Announcement↩︎
title: The Cathedral is Re-Opening!↩︎
color: red↩︎
desc: |↩︎
  We have events planned for this weekend and next!↩︎
  And Weekday Mass resumes Tuesday!↩︎
  See below for event times.↩︎
↩︎
  Our schedule will be updated during the process of↩︎
  re-opening. Be sure to↩︎
  [join our mailing list](https://...)↩︎
  for the latest updates as they happen.
```

A YAML document is written as one or more lines of characters, each terminated by an invisible *newline character*, shown here by a ↩︎. A YAML document is parsed by machines character by character (including the newlines) in order to identify the elements within. Care must be taken to write *valid* YAML according to the syntax rules, otherwise it's rejected. Note that the placement of space and newline characters, collectively known as *whitespace*, is important, because indentation is significant in YAML, and because Markdown uses a blank line (two consecutive newline characters) to represent paragraph separation.

Structurally, the above document starts with a comment, on its first line. Comments begin with a hash character and are meant for humans, but otherwise ignored during parsing. In our case, placing a comment on the first line of a tweet is a useful convention given that they'll be seen by humans as well as machines.

The subsequent lines define data fields, which are written as *key-value pairs*. The key is a name, such as `title`, followed by a colon. The value, known as a *scalar* in YAML, written after the colon, is the text associated with the key. For our purposes, the keys represent the various data fields defined for tweets we'll place in our collections, while the values are either the text that will appear on the website for those items (e.g., title text) or that will be used to specify some kind of effect (e.g., color). In the example above, the `title` and `color` keys define the **Title** and **Color** fields of an announcement (see Reference). Title text is self-explanatory; a color, if specified, is used to override the default color for the title (and subtitle) of the announcement. (These fields also exist for events.)

The **Title** and **Color** values are ordinary scalars, or short text strings, and so appear on the same line as the key. However, the fourth and subsequent lines show a key with a *block scalar*. The **Descriptive** field, identified by the `desc` key, is usually written as multi-text text. Each line of the text is considered subordinate to the key, so each line must be written with indentation (two spaces each line in the example). In addition, the pipe character written after the `desc` key indicates that the indented lines that follow belong to the `desc` key and comprise its text value. The pipe character also indicates that newline characters are to be preserved in the text. Preservation of newline characters (as opposed to collapsing them) is important in our YAML documents, because the placement of newline characters is significant in Markdown syntax, particularly to indicate paragraph separation. Note that the whitespace forming the indentations are *not* taken as part of the text value.

The **Descriptive** field and its multi-line text value, which can be used in both announcement and event documents, is the only field that accepts Markdown text. The above example consists of two paragraphs; the blank line indicates paragraph separation in Markdown. It also demonstrates the insertion of a hyperlink (on the second-last line). Although Markdown supports many formatting indicators and other insertable objects, the **Descriptive** field supports only bold and italic text and the insertion of hyperlinks.


## Continuations

The Announcements, Regular Events, and Special Events collections (but not the Bulletins collection) support a feature we call *continuation tweets*. In general, tweets are limited to a maximum of 280 characters, which can be too short for a single tweet to accommodate content intended for the website, particularly descriptive text. Continuations allow multiple consecutive tweets to contribute to the descriptive text of a single announcement or event.

A given announcement, regular event, or special event is introduced in its respective collection by a *primary tweet*. A primary tweet always contains a **Title**, in addition to any other fields that are present. A continuation tweet specifies *only* the **Descriptive** field and must follow its parent primary tweet in the collection. Its text value is appended to the descriptive text of its parent. More than one consecutive continuation tweet may follow a primary tweet. Authors must take care to arranged the tweets correctly in the collection.



# Reference


## Announcements

https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1270455700167307267

Announcements express something presently noteworthy in the life of the parish. An announcement always has a title, with an optional subtitle. A color may be specified for the title and subtitle (if present) to override the default. Announcements are usually written with descriptive text, but may be omitted. As a special feature, announcements may also carry an embedded YouTube video.

Note that items scheduled to occur on a specific date and time are better suited as regular or special events rather than announcements.

### Announcement document

Field       | Key     | Required | Markdown | Value type
:----       | :--     | :------- | :------- | :---------
Title       | title   | Yes      | No       | Single-line text
Subtitle    | sub     | No       | No       | Single-line text
Color       | color   | No       | No       | Web color
YouTube     | youtube | No       | No       | YouTube video ID
Descriptive | desc    | No       | Yes      | Multi-line text

Each announcement requires the **Title** field. The other fields are optional and may be omitted.

Both the **Title** and **Subtitle** fields are single-line text values. Include the subtitle only if necessary. Single-line text fields do not support Markdown syntax.

The **Color** field is written as a color name or a hash-prefixed three- or six-digit RGB hexadecimal triplet. Hex triplets should be enclosed in single- or double-quotes, otherwise YAML interprets the initial hash character as the beginning of a comment. See https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp for color names. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet for information on hex triplets. *Tip: Use the **Color** field sparingly!*

The **YouTube** field specifies the video ID of a YouTube video to be embedded as part of the announcement. The video appears below the title/subtitle, above the descriptive text. Care should be taken to isolate the video ID from a YouTube link. The recommended way to retrieve a shareable YouTube link is to copy the *short link* provided by the Share function available on each video. For example, https://youtu.be/dneww9vZh5g is a YouTube short link. The entire path segment ("dneww9vZh5g" here) is the video ID. In the canonical form of a YouTube link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dneww9vZh5g, the **v** parameter specifies the video ID.

The **Descriptive** field accepts multiple lines of Markdown text. The **Descriptive** field may be omitted entirely if appropriate. See the discussion above concerning newline preservation and indentation in YAML, as well as paragraph separation in Markdown.

For announcements needing long descriptive text, continuations are used. See the discussion above concerning continuations. A continuation tweet always contains a **Descriptive** field but *omits* the **Title** field, and it must follow a primary tweet (or another continuation) in the collection. For announcements with continuations, it is recommended to omit the **Descriptive** field in the primary tweet and use continuations to provide all the descriptive text. The initial comment should indicate that the tweet is a continuation (see examples).

### Examples

#### An announcement

```
# Announcement
title: Some Wonderful Announcement
sub: The Best Announcement Ever!
color: red
desc: |
  Get your shiny, fabulous, all-you-can eat whatsits,
  on sale today!

  And remember:
  When your only tool is a hammer, every problem
  looks like a nail.
  —Abraham Maslow
```

#### An announcement with only a title and descriptive text

```
# Announcement
title: One Simple Announcement
desc: |
  No subtitle. No color override. No embedded video.
  Just a single paragraph of descriptive text.
```

#### An announcement with only a title

```
# Announcement
title: Attention! Look up!
```

#### An announcement with an embedded YouTube video

```
# Announcement
title: Vertical Video Syndrome
youtube: f2picMQC-9E
desc: |
  Just say no to vertical videos.
```

#### An announcement featuring bold and italics in the descriptive

```
# Announcement
title: Some Wonderful Announcement
desc: |
  Express *emphasis* with italics.

  Make a **strong** statement using bold.
```

#### An announcement with a hyperlink in the descriptive

```
# Announcement
title: Some Wonderful Announcement
desc: |
  Everyone loves attending
  [The Cathedral](https://stpeterspeterborough.ca/),
  the best church in town!

  Tip: It looks better and can help with controlling line length
  to place hyperlink syntax on a line of its own.
```

#### An announcement with continuations

```
# Announcement
title: An Information-Filled Announcement
```

```
# Announcement continued
desc: |
  This is an announcement whose descriptive is provided by more
  than one continuation. This is the first continuation tweet,
  immediately following the primary tweet in its collection.
  This is the first paragraph of the announcement.
```

```
# Announcement continued
desc: |
  This second continuation follows the first, both of which
  are attached to the primary tweet above.

  It also contains the third and fourth paragraphs.
  There's always an implicit paragraph separation between
  the first and second continuations.
```

```
# Announcement continued
desc: |
  As a reminder, a single newline character in YAML merely
  ends the current line. You can insert explicit newlines
  anywhere, to write clean, short lines for each paragraph.
```

```
# Announcement continued
desc: |
  When parsed by a Markdown interpreter or when rendered in
  a web browser, newlines are turned into inline whitespace.

  One exception: Double newline characters
  in Markdown mean an explicit paragraph separation.
```


## Regular Events and Special Events

https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1253030671557308420
https://twitter.com/cathedralstpet/timelines/1253030938398859265

Events represent scheduled occasions in the life of the parish. Events are divided into two general classifications, regular and special. Regular events are intended for signature faith events which typically occur predictably on a weekly or monthly basis. These include Holy Mass, confessions, and devotions. Special events are irregular or unique events, such as socials or specially scheduled faith events. Regular events are scheduled on a day (or days) of the week, while special events are scheduled with a full calendar date.

### Event document

Field       | Key   | Required | Markdown | Value type
:----       | :--   | :------- | :------- | :---------
Title       | title | Yes      | No       | Single-line text
Subtitle    | sub   | No       | No       | Single-line text
Color       | color | No       | No       | Web color
Location    | loc   | No       | No       | Single-line text
Times       | times | No       | No       | List of Schedule documents
Descriptive | desc  | No       | Yes      | Multi-line text

### Schedule document

Field | Key  | Required | Markdown | Value type
:---- | :--  | :------- | :------- | :---------
Day   | day  | Yes      | No       | Day or date; see below
Time  | time | Yes      | No       | Time; see below

Each event requires the **Title** field. The other top-level fields are optional and may be omitted. Note that the **Day** and **Time** fields belong to sub-elements of the **Times** list. Both fields are required for each sub-element.

Both the **Title** and **Subtitle** fields are single-line text values. Single-line text fields do not support Markdown. Include a Subtitle only if necessary for the title of the event.

The **Color** field specifies a color name or a hash-prefixed three- or six-digit RGB hex triplet. Hex triplets should be enclosed in single- or double-quotes, otherwise YAML interprets the initial hash character as the beginning of a comment. See https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp for color names. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet for information on hex triplets. *Tip: Use the **Color** field sparingly!*

The **Location** field is a single-line text value. It is recommended to omit the **Location** field for events held inside the Cathedral main building (e.g., Holy Mass, confessions, devotions). Specify a location if the venue is somewhere other than the auditorium of the main building (e.g., the Rectory, another church, a specific area or room within the ). This could include a specific area or room inside the main building (e.g., the Sacristy) if such information would be helpful for attendees.

The **Times** field specifies a YAML list. Each sub-element is a Schedule document that specifies *both* a **Day** and a **Time** field. The purpose of the list is to allow more than one discrete day-time pair, as some events are scheduled at multiple times. Care must be taken to write the necessary indentations—the list entries (indicated by the dash syntax) are subordinate to the `times` key, and each Schedule document is subordinate to its respective list entry. See the examples below. The **Times** list is optional and may be omitted, which allows for special cases where scheduling need not be given.

The **Day** and **Time** fields in a Schedule document are single-line text values. No specific format is defined for how days/dates and times are to be written, but a format should be adopted and applied consistently. The **Day** field typically specifies day(s) of the week (e.g., Sunday, Monday-Friday) for regular events, but a full calendar date for special events (e.g., June 17, 2020). The **Time** field specifies one or more individual times (e.g., 7:30 AM, 12:10 PM), typically the start time of an event, but may also be written as a time range (e.g., 3:00-5:00 PM, 11:00 AM-1:00 PM) where the duration or the expected end time of the event can or should be communicated.

The **Descriptive** field accepts multiple lines of Markdown text. The **Descriptive** field may be omitted entirely if appropriate. See the discussion above concerning newline preservation and indentation in YAML, and paragraph separation in Markdown.

For events needing long descriptive text, continuations are used. See the discussion above concerning Continuations. A continuation tweet always contains a **Descriptive** field but *omits* the **Title** field, and it must follow a primary tweet (or another continuation) in the collection. For events with continuations, it is recommended to omit the **Descriptive** field in the primary tweet and use continuations to provide all the descriptive text. The initial comment should indicate that the tweet is a continuation (see examples).

### Examples

#### A regular event, with descriptive text in a continuation

```
# Event

```


## Bulletins

Tweets intended for the Bulletins collection represent the weekly bulletin entries that appear on the home page. The home page displays a maximum number of six bulletin entries. Care should be taken to arrange tweets in the Bulletins collection in order from most to least recent. Only the first six tweets are used. It is recommended to keep a minimum of six in the collection for aesthetics, and to delete older bulletin tweets on a regular basis.

### Bulletin document

Field    | Key     | Required | Markdown | Value type
:----    | :--     | :------- | :------- | :---------
Date     | date    | Yes      | No       | Date; see below
Title    | title   | Yes      | No       | Single-line text
Subtitle | sub     | No       | No       | Single-line text
Link     | link    | Yes      | No       | URL
Inserts  | inserts | No       | No       | List of Insert documents

### Insert document

Field | Key   | Required | Markdown | Value type
:---- | :--   | :------- | :------- | :---------
Title | title | Yes      | No       | Single-line text
Libk  | link  | Yes      | No       | URL

Each bulletin requires the **Date**, **Title**, and **Link** fields. The **Subtitle** and **Inserts** fields are optional and may be ommitted. Within the **Inserts** list, the sub-elements are Insert documents having **Title** and **Link** fields. Both are fields required for each sub-element.

Note that bulletins, unlike announcements and events, have no descriptive text and therefore do not support continuations. Also, Markdown text is not used in bulletin tweets.

The **Date** field specifies the full calendar date (e.g., June 21, 2020) of the bulletin, typically a Sunday. No specific format is defined for how dates are written, but a format should be adopted and applied consistently.

Both the **Title** and **Subtitle** fields are single-line text values. Single-line text fields do not support Markdown. It is recommended to entitle bulletins with the ordinal within the respective season of the liturgical year; for example, *Fourth Sunday in Lent* or *Eighth Sunday of Easter*, and use the subtitle for the solemnity when one occurs, as in *Feast of Corpus Christi* or *Feast of Pentecost*. Alternatively, write the solemnity as the title when the ordinal and season are not specified, and omit a subtitle.

The top-level **Link** field specifies the absolute URL of the bulletin resource. This is usually a PDF stored on Google Drive. Care should be taken to get a shareable link from Google Drive, as in the form shown in the examples below.

The **Inserts** field specifies a YAML list. Each sub-element is an Insert document that specifies *both* a **Title** and a **Link** field. The purpose of the list is to allow a variable number of inserts to accompany a given bulletin. Care must be taken to write the necessary indentations—the list entries (indicated by the dash syntax) are subordinate to the `inserts` key, and each Insert document is subordinate to its respective list entry. See the examples below. Note that the **Inserts** list is optional and may be omitted when there are no inserts.

### Examples

#### A bulletin with title and subtitle, no inserts

```
# Bulletin
date: May 31, 2020
title: Eighth Sunday of Easter
sub: Feast of Pentecost
link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Odu4Ku-sZcLc5JOJ81wWiKdvEptzuH2u/view
